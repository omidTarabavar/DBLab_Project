# Learning Management System

Course: Database Lab

Description:
This project is a GUI-based Learning Management System (LMS) developed in C# using Windows Forms as part of the Database Lab course. The LMS allows users to register as either students or professors, with distinct features for each role:

* Professor Features: Professors can create and manage courses, upload content, and oversee course activities.
* Student Features: Students can register for courses, access course content, and participate in course activities.
  
This project showcases my skills in GUI development, database management, and user access control within a C# environment.
