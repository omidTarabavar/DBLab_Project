# Learning Management System

Course: Database Lab

Description:
This project is a GUI-based Learning Management System (LMS) developed in C# using Windows Forms and SQL for data management, as part of the Database Lab course. The LMS enables users to register as either students or professors, with distinct features for each role:

* Professor Features: Professors can create and manage courses, upload content, and oversee course activities.
* Student Features: Students can register for courses, access course content, and participate in course activities.

SQL databases are used to store user information, course details, and other essential data, demonstrating my skills in both database management and GUI development in a C# environment.
