# LMS Project
Overview
This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) developed as the final project for our Database Lab class under the guidance of Dr. Samanipour. The LMS aims to facilitate the management and delivery of educational courses, providing tools for instructors to create and manage course content, and for students to access and interact with the materials.
